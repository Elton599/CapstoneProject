  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/our-story-image.jpg" alt="Our Story">
    <p>I had a dream to live and raise children in the Cape, so we bought an aging Victorian Grand Dame and 
      threw ourselves into it with gusto and little regard for budget. With only two labourers assisting we stripped, sanded, varnished, and 
      rehung every wooden ceiling, found ancient wallpaper, and removed years of dust. The kitchen was gutted and rebuilt with reclaimed 
      Oregan pine, lead & glass windows, and African Teak counters. My Good Friend Samkelo has an exceptional eye for detail and a focus for doing whatever 
      he tackles properly, making him a great carpenter. We upgraded and renovated the kitchen, pantry, storeroom, extractor fan cover and scullery 
      section to open the property as a guesthouse in 2015.</p>

  <h2>Our Food</h2>
  <div class="image-container">

    <p>Meals at Elton's Restaurant are made with love and passion.  Our country food is respectful of ingredients, unpretentiously fine dining, 
      honestly delicious and served with true country style and flair. We are hugely particular about ethically sourcing the freshest 
      best produce from small local suppliers and growers. Our wine is sourced from the Overberg area (mostly Robertson), our meat and eggs from 
      the divine Country Butcher, our fish from Sustainable Trout and the Little Fisherman, our flour from Eureka Mills, our vegetables from 
      Little Oaks and so on. We hand make everything we can, from our breads, cheese biscuits and cakes to our truffles that appear at evening 
      turndown. We also pay particular attention to dietary requirements, from lactose intolerant to vegan and everything in between.  
      Since Chef Wander joined us in 2011 and began serving dinner in The Conservatory, we have grown from strength to strength.  
      We can honestly say that over the years, The Conservatory Restaurant has become one of the finest of Cape Town's Restaurants.</p>
